# Propagandist
## Description
Welcome to the Propagandist, where I amuse myself by creating propaganda promoting ME and my projects. This code serves to create a website on which my information, contact and otherwise, as well as my current and upcoming projects can be showcased in an accessible and visually pleasing manner (an insight into my aesthetic preferences).
